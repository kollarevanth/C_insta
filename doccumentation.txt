implemented UserDataCommands and UserOpertations excepts sendmsg and read msgs;
Level 1 implimentation Completed;
Level 2 implimentation Completed;

My code can handle multiple clients since i used threadpool concept;
Only the requests are sent by the client;
All the modifications and printing the results are done at server;
I have used socket-programs to communicate;
Some example commands are:
create user username
update user old new;
post username postname path
commentonpost username postname comment
removepost postname
updatepost username oldpostname newpostname
likepost postname
savepost post disk
uploadfile username filename;
viewfiles user;
downloadfiles filename disk;
viewcomment postname
removeuser username
use "sync" to sync at client side
